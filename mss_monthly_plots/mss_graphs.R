#DESCCRIPTION: This script pulls data from the data cat, merges it with
#meta data from the web portal (via API) and produce box and whisker plots for

Full Explanation: The above box and whisker plot shows five statistics, the first and third quantile, the median, and two whiskers. The 
whiskers extend to the largest value or no further than 1.5 x IQR from the third quantile (where IQR is the inter-quartile range, or
distance between the first and third quartiles). The lower whisker extends from the first quantile to the smallest value or at most
1.5 x IQR. Data beyond the end of the whiskers are called `outlying` points and are plotted individually.
